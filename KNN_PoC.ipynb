Here’s how it works in plain language:\n","\n","---\n","\n","## How KNN Works\n","\n","1. **Think of points on a map**  \n","   - Each data point is like a dot in space, based on its features (e.g., age, income, spending score).  \n","   - Points that are “closer together” are more similar.\n","\n","2. **New data comes in**  \n","   - Suppose we have a new point (e.g., a new customer).  \n","   - We want to predict its label (e.g., will they buy the product?).\n","\n","3. **Find the nearest neighbors**  \n","   - Measure the distance between the new point and all existing points.  \n","   - Common distance metric: **Euclidean distance** (straight-line distance).  \n","   - Pick the **k closest points**. These are the “nearest neighbors.”\n","\n","4. **Vote among the neighbors**  \n","   - For classification:\n","     - Each neighbor “votes” for its class (e.g., buys = 1, doesn’t buy = 0).  \n","     - The class with the most votes is assigned to the new point.  \n","   - For regression:\n","     - Take the average of the neighbors’ values.\n","\n","5. **Output the prediction**  \n","   - The new point is labeled based on the majority vote (classification) or average (regression).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Key Points\n","\n","- **Choice of k**:  \n","  - Small k → sensitive to noise (may overfit).  \n","  - Large k → smoother predictions, may miss small patterns.\n","\n","- **Scaling matters**:  \n","  - KNN uses distances. Features with larger scales dominate unless we scale all features.\n","\n","- **Non-parametric**:  \n","  - KNN doesn’t assume any underlying distribution. It “learns” from the data directly.\n","\n","- **Lazy learner**:  \n","  - KNN doesn’t really train a model in the traditional sense. It just stores the data and computes distances at prediction time.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Intuition\n","\n","- Imagine a group of people in a park, and you want to predict if a new person likes soccer.  \n","- You look at the **nearest k people** to them: if most of them like soccer, you predict that the new person probably likes soccer too.  \n","- That’s essentially how KNN works, just with numbers instead of people.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"22S_kgkFnEgR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# build KNN model\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","\n","knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)\n","knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":80},"id":"KJIjv7mwcyrA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763075000306,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Colton Wismer","userId":"01060287292781936877"}},"outputId":"ac982e7f-c2aa-4795-9808-0136b2d9a753"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["KNeighborsClassifier()"],"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  /* Definition of color scheme common for light and dark mode */\n","  --sklearn-color-text: #000;\n","  --sklearn-color-text-muted: #666;\n","  --sklearn-color-line: gray;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for unfitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-0: #fff5e6;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-1: #f6e4d2;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-2: #ffe0b3;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-3: chocolate;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for fitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-0: #f0f8ff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-1: #d4ebff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-2: #b3dbfd;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-3: cornflowerblue;\n","\n","  /* Specific color for light theme */\n","  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, white)));\n","  --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-icon: #696969;\n","\n","  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n","    /* Redefinition of color scheme for dark theme */\n","    --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, #111)));\n","    --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-icon: #878787;\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  color: var(--sklearn-color-text);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 pre {\n","  padding: 0;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {\n","  border: 0;\n","  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);\n","  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n","  height: 1px;\n","  margin: -1px;\n","  overflow: hidden;\n","  padding: 0;\n","  position: absolute;\n","  width: 1px;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {\n","  border: 1px dashed var(--sklearn-color-line);\n","  margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;\n","  box-sizing: border-box;\n","  padding-bottom: 0.4em;\n","  background-color: var(--sklearn-color-background);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {\n","  /* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none;
