# Machine Learning Proofs of Concept (PoCs)

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning proofs of concept** implemented in Python.  
Each notebook focuses on a core ML algorithm and demonstrates both the **theory** and **practical application** of the technique on example datasets.

The goal of this repository is to showcase hands-on understanding of common machine learning methods, model behavior, and evaluation techniques.
