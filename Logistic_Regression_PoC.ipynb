Regression is a **machine learning algorithm** used to **predict yes/no outcomes** (like 0 or 1, true or false).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## How It Works\n","\n","1. **Combine the input features**  \n","   The model multiplies each input feature by a weight and adds a bias to get a single number:\n","\n","\n","2. **Convert to a probability**  \n","The number is passed through a **sigmoid function** to

probability < 0.5 → predict 0\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Training the Model\n","\n","- The goal is to **find the best weights and bias** so predictions are close to actual outcomes.  \n","- The model measures error with a **loss function** (binary cross-entropy) and adjusts weights using optimization methods like **gradient descent**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Key Points\n","\n","- Outputs probabilities, not just class labels.  \n","- Works best with linearly separable data.  \n","- Features should be scaled for faster and more stable training.  \n","- Weights are interpretable: larger weights = more influence on the prediction.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Advantages\n","\n","- Simple and easy to understand  \n","- Fast to train  \n","- Provides probabilities  \n","- Good baseline for classification tasks  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## Limitations\n","\n","- Can’t capture complex non-linear relationships alone  \n","- Sensitive to outliers  \n","- Performance may drop if features are
